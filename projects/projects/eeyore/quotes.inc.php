'"That Accounts for a Good Deal," said Eeyore gloomily. "It Explains Everything. No Wonder." 
"You must have left it somewhere," said Winnie the Pooh.
"Somebody must have taken it," said Eeyore. "How Like Them," he added, after a long silence.', 


'"Good morning, Pooh Bear," said Eeyore gloomily. "If it is a good morning," he said. "Which I doubt," said he.
"Why, what\'s the matter?"
"Nothing, Pooh Bear, nothing. We can\'t all, and some of us don\'t. That\'s all there is to it."
"Can\'t all what?" said Pooh, rubbing his nose.
"Gaiety. Song-and-dance. Here we go round the mulberry bush."',


'"So it does!" said Pooh. "It goes in!"
"So it does!" said Piglet. "And it comes out!"
"Doesn\'t it?" said Eeyore. "It goes in and out like anything."',
 
 

'"I\'m not asking anybody," said Eeyore. 
"I\'m just telling everybody. We can look for the North Pole, or we can play \'Here we go gathering Nuts in May\' 
with the end part of an ants\' nest. It\'s all the same to me."', 
 

'"Hallo, Pooh. Thank you for asking, but I shall be able to use it again in a day or two."
"Use what?" said Pooh.
"What we were talking about."
"I wasn\'t talking about anything," said Pooh, looking puzzled.
"My mistake again. I thought you were saying how sorry you were about my tail, being all numb, and could you do anything to help?"
"No," said Pooh. "That wasn\'t me," he said. He thought for a little and then suggested helpfully: "Perhaps it was somebody else."
"Well, thank him for me when you see him."',
 
 

'"Eeyore," said Owl, "Christopher Robin is giving a party."
 "Very interesting," said Eeyore. "I suppose they will be sending me down the odd bits which got trodden on. 
 Kind and Thoughtful. Not at all, don\'t mention it."', 
 

'"I might have known," said Eeyore. "After all, one can\'t complain. I have my friends. 
Somebody spoke to me only yesterday. And was it last week or the week before that Rabbit bumped into me and said \'Bother!\'. 
The Social Round. Always something going on."',
 

 

'"It\'s snowing still," said Eeyore gloomily.
"So it is."
"And freezing."
"Is it?"
"Yes," said Eeyore. "However," he said, brightening up a little, "we haven\'t had an earthquake lately."',
 

 

'"It\'s Pooh," said Christopher Robin excitedly...
"Possibly," said Eeyore.
"And Piglet!" said Christopher Robin excitedly.
"Probably," said Eeyore, "What we want is a Trained Bloodhound."',
 

 

'Eeyore walked all round Tigger one way, and then turned and walked round him the other way.
"What did you say it was?" he asked.
"Tigger."
"Ah!" said Eeyore.
"He\'s just come," explained Piglet.
"Ah!" said Eeyore again.
He thought for a long time and then said: "When is he going?"',
 

 

'"Could you ask your friend to do his exercises somewhere else? 
I shall be having lunch directly, and don\'t want it bounced on just before I begin. 
A trifling matter, and fussy of me, but we all have our little ways."',
 

 

'"I thought," said Piglet earnestly, "that if Eeyore stood at the bottom of the tree, and if Pooh stood on Eeyore\'s back, 
and if I stood on Pooh\'s shoulders -"
"And if Eeyore\'s back snapped suddenly, then we could all laugh. Ha Ha! Amusing in a quiet way," said Eeyore, 
"but not really helpful."
"Well," said Piglet meekly, "I thought -"
"Would it break your back, Eeyore?" asked Pooh, very much surprised.
"That\'s what would be so interesting, Pooh. Not being quite sure till afterwards."',
 

 

'"I\'m telling you. People come and go in this forest, and they say. \'It\'s only Eeyore, so it doesn\'t count.\' 
They walk to and fro saying \'Ha Ha!\'. But do they know anything about A? They don\'t. It\'s just three sticks to them. 
But to the Educated - mark this, little Piglet - to the Educated, not meaning Poohs and Piglets, it\'s a great and glorious A. 
Not," he added, "just something that anybody can come and breathe on."
Piglet stepped back nervously, and looked round for help.',
 

 

'"Eeyore, what are you doing there?" said Rabbit.
"I\'ll give you three guesses, Rabbit. Digging holes in the ground? Wrong. Leaping from branch to branch of a young oak tree? 
Wrong. Waiting for somebody to help me out of the river? Right. Give Rabbit time, and he\'ll always get the answer."
"But, Eeyore," said Pooh in distress, "what can we - I mean, how shall we - do you think if we -"
"Yes," said Eeyore. "One of those would be just the thing. Thank you, Pooh."',
 

 

'"Oh, Eeyore, you are wet!" said Piglet, feeling him.
Eeyore shook himself, and asked somebody to explain to Piglet what happened when you had been inside a river for quite a long time.',

 

 

'"That\'s right, Eeyore. Drop in on any of us at any time, when you feel like it."
"Thank you, Rabbit. And if anybody says in a Loud Voice \'Bother, it\'s Eeyore,\' I can drop out again."',
 

 

'"Hitherto, all the Poetry in the Forest has been written by Pooh, a Bear with a Pleasing Manner but a Positively Startling Lack of Brain. 
The Poem which I am now about to read to you was written by Eeyore, or Myself, in a Quiet Moment. 
If somebody will take Roo\'s bull\'s eye away from him, and wake up Owl, we shall all be able to enjoy it. I call it - POEM."',
 

 

'He turned around angrily on the others and said "Everybody crowds round so in this Forest. There\'s no Space. 
I never saw a more Spreading lot of animals in my life, and in all the wrong places."'
