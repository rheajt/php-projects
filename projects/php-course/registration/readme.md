Web-based registration - Create a database-driven registration form that takes user information and stores that information on the server. You will need to create the necessary database, as well as the table.

Requirements:

Allow the user to enter a User Name and check the database to see if an entry already exists.
Allow the user to create a new record in the database if the User Name does not exist. 

First Name
Last Name
User Name
Password
Display database information to the user.
Allow the user to update database information.
Allow the user to upload a file and save it to the server.
Maintain on the server a simple log file called registration_log.txt that keeps a log that a user has accessed the database. Use append to store the User Name to the registration_log.txt file for each logon.
