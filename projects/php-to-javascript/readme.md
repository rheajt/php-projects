# PHP-to-Javascript

##This is more practice with PHP, and refamiliarizing myself with the small amount of Javascript that I know. The PHP will read the file into an array which is sent to javascript to process on the screen.

##In this case, javascript will display sentences in the form of draggable/droppable boxes.
